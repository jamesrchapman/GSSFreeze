    """
I'm looking at a bunch of variables from a survey and how they're going to predict these dependent variables which are also survey questions. 
So, the issue I'm running into is that the survey questions are different formats right - like what I want to do is find all of the variables that are convincingly associated with variation in the dependent variables (independent of each other). 
So I need help figuring out how to find significance between different types of survey questions and the predictor variables - e.g. how do I associate nominal independent with ordinal dependent. How do I associate ordinal with nominal, ratio with ordinal, all combinations. 

Then I want to hold onto those variables for each predictor. 
Then the real kicker is looking to associate each validated predictor variable with the dependent variables in all pairs over those variables. I want to look at some kind of regression model and to examine the bayes information criterion or AIC or whatever. Something like that, to see if the interaction of the pairs explains a good deal more of the variance than independently. 
I don't know what kind of regression to do for the different question formats again! how do you predict ordinal variables with a pair of nominal and ordinal inputs? etc. 

and then there's a validation issue where I should probably look at random data to make sure it's not just an artifact of the model. 




Regression by Dependent Variable Type
Ordinal Dependent Variable: Use Ordinal Logistic Regression. This can handle both nominal and ratio predictors, as well as interaction terms.
Nominal Dependent Variable: Use Multinomial Logistic Regression.
Ratio Dependent Variable: Use Linear Regression or Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for non-normal distributions.

Including Interaction Terms
To evaluate interactions:

Create interaction terms by multiplying predictors
Use a regression model suited to your dependent variable (e.g., ordinal logistic regression for ordinal outcomes).
Compare model fits using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Models with lower AIC/BIC are preferred, but ensure theyâ€™re not overfitting.
